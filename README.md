# CS-350

The project was to create a thermostat that could periodically check the temperature of the room with a sensor and turn the heat on if it is colder than the set temperature. This creates a solution for multiple problems. For example, it helps reserve power for the home owmer, reduces energy costs, and can prevent pipes from freezing if the home owner is not home.

I feel that what I did really well was writing comments throughout the code. It made it a lot easier for me when I was going back through and troubleshooting the issues that came up during development.

I feel where I could improve is thoroughly reviewing the code. I made a few mistakes on the project which could have been resolved if I looked a little closer when going through the program. For example, my timer interval was 1000000 instead of 10000. 

The tools and resources that I am adding to my support network would be working with Code Compposer Studio and working with microcontrollers. During this course, this was my first time using CCS and first time programming a microcontroller. I learned more about how to program embedded systems.

The skills from this project that are transferable to other projects would be the troubleshooting skills I've gained from this course. Since this was my first time coding with a microcontroller, it was the first time programming for something I can physically see in front of me. Initially, I had connection issues from the USB to microUSB connection. I learned more about troubleshooting on the physical layer. I also learned more about troubleshooting error codes. I was able to look up a lot of the error codes I ran across on StackOverflow. 

I made the project maintainable, readable, and adaptable by writing comments throughout the code. The comments in the code allow me, or others, to review the code and understand what it is doing. This is good practice if working in a team because then we would all be able to follow along with the codes functions. It is adaptable because other peripherals can be added onto the project. For example, an LCD screen can be added to display the information instead of using LED lights.
